 &lt;-- Yup, that's me. <a href="http://jaredigreene.com">Jared i.Greene</a>. I'm a web developer, multimedia designer, and writer. This website is a culmination of some of my work throughout the years. I am a man of adventure and sport; when I'm not geeking out, you can find me rock climbing, kiteboarding, downhill longboarding,  snowboarding, kayaking, hiking, or anything else that's outdoors.<br />
